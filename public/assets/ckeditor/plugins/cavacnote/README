This plugin let's you add "Cavac Notes", Link-like text
sections that pop up a small jquery dialog with additional
informations or witty hints.

On the viewer side of things (not in ckeditor), you need the
additional jquery plugin in the jquery subfolder, and call
    $("span.cavacnote").cavacnote();
during your jquery initialization (onload or whenever)

You also need to use the CSS provided in the css subfolder
in order for the pseudo-link to get rendered correctly (of course,
you may adapt the CSS properties to fit your design).
